# Landing
This page is describe my github page to any potential employers interested in my work.
During my application period I will temporarily open up access to my repos for the school projects so that they are viewable, however, since 2 of the repositories are indeed school projects to protect the code from being copied I will be taking the repos down after I secure my summer internship. If there are any projects on my resume that you wish to see that aren't on here please email me and I will be happy to provide.
